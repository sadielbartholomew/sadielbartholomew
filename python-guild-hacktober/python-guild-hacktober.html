    <h3>What is Hacktober(fest)?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="next"> <i>Hacktober(fest)</i> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <b>October</b> as a month-long drive for <b>open-source software contribution</b>
      <li class="next"> A &#10077;<b>do it in your own time</b>&#10078; hackathon of sorts
      <li class="next"> In <b>figures</b>:
        <ul>
          <li class="next"> 2018 &rarr; <mark>fifth year</mark>
          <li class="next"> make <mark>5+ PRs</mark> on GitHub (rules apply)
          <li class="next"> completed by <mark>&gt; 46,000 people</mark>...
          <li class="next"> ...from <mark>~140 countries</mark>
          <li class="next"> eligible PRs to <mark>&gt; 100,000 GitHub repos</mark>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
      * 'much like other positive-influence or charity based month drives,
       think Go Sober October or Movember, etc'
      * nothing to do with 'Oktoberfest', though beer may optionaly be consumed while coding
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li class="next"> <b>Freebies</b> up for grabs!<br>

    </div>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
      * If willing to allow Digital... to access your GitHub account...
      * ... e.g. had to sign agreement with Facebook, a company I detest.
      * I completed, so was one of those 46,000. Full disclosure: only got
        to 5 in October itself due to work PRs!
      * most common listing under Hacktober & Python language was
        'our documentation needs updating / polishing / writing'.
      * my favourite listed issue was 'our project needs a GUI... build us a
        GUI'
      * Sadly no freebies to show off as they ship from the USA & have not
        arrived...

    <h3> #1: Python as a swiss-army knife</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> inspiring <b>project diversity</b> in Python Hacktober list
           ...perhaps
           expect for a general language, but more so (?) for Python, which
           is <b>highly versatile</b>:
        <ul>
          <li> general-purpose & multi-paradigm
          <li> extensive & well-supported ecosystem to utilise (sample via PyPI)
          <li> good (enough) for a lot of applications.
        </ul>
      <li> <b>segregate</b> the <b>issue from</b> the <b>project</b>:
        <ul>
          <li> don’t be put off by the overall project scope
          <li> e.g. don’t need to be a qualified glaciologist to improve plot
               colormaps!
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
       * GENERALLY well-supported ecosystem [libraries, frameworks, tools]
       * paradigm [OO, structured, functional ...]
       * [and your Python abilities, 'at hand'] [obviously has its weaknesses,]
       * [sample via ‘browse projects’ in PyPI]
       * wide range
       * [issue to be solved]
       * glaciology expert
       * => investment in Python ‘as a tool’ is worthwhile
       * preaching to the choir, but point is invest in your Python abilities
         will pay off dividends.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3> #2: the Python community is diverse</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> interacted with only a <b>tiny sample</b>, however they:
        <ul>
          <li> were all kind & constructive
          <li> hailed from all over globe (none UK-based!)
          <li> had expertise in wide-ranging areas.
        </ul>

      <li> <b>Have audience in mind when writing code comments & docs:</b>
        <ul>
          <li> English skills vary; keep language simple
          <li> consider your assumptions! Don't assume background
               knowledge or environment (etc.)
          <li> don't use e.g. <i>simply</i> or <i>self-explanatory</i>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
      * PYTHONISTAS, i.e. friendly
      * Given first point => second.
      * 'so try to have...' [so they aren't excluded]
        [English as first language]
      * [America, Austria, Russia!]
      * will be frustrating to them & embarrasing to you when there are bugs
        or typos breaking things.
      * what's obvious to one person may not be to another
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3> #3: Python projects > Python (& other) scripts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> There's <b>more to a project than</b> a collection of Python plus
           some config / admin / other language <b>scripts</b>. Consider:
        <ul>
          <li> packaging & dependencies
          <li> code style e.g. PEP 8 or stricter
          <li> code structure & higher-level 'style'
          <li> testing: methods, rigour & strictness on coverage
          <li> documentation
          <li> contribution guidelines
          <li> vision & ethos
        </ul>
      <li> Code with context!
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
      * [consistent, suitable in context]
      * ...

<section>
    <h3> #1: Environment set-up can be tricky</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> There are <b>a lot of options for packaging & set-up</b> of projects
      <li> Projects typically have a lot of (often specific-version)
           <b>dependencies</b> that need to be managed.
        <ul>
          <li> specific (& if desired virtual) envs commonly set-up
               via <b>pip</b>, <b>conda</b> &/or <b>virtualenv</b>
          <li> advise to follow docs install instructions to the word, but
               these would often not work due to e.g. bugs or typos.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
      * whole environment setup, packaging, testing framework & coverage &
        strictness in use of, & documentation approach.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3> #2: Python 3 has some great features!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> From the perspective of a version 2 developer, Python 3
           (varying 3.<i>X</i>) was great to work with. Would like to
           highlight two features...
      <li> <b>Function annotations:</b> specifications, not assertions
        <ul>
          <li> <i>Type</i> annotations:
          <div class="codebox">
            <code>def caps(word: str) -> str:</code><br>
          </div>

          <li> Custom package annotations e.g. <i>units</i>:
          <div class="codebox">
            <code>def energy(mass: u.kg):</code><br>
          </div>

        </ul>
      <li> <b>Chained exceptions:</b> no concealed traceback!
          </div>
    </ul>

    <div role="note">Elaborate:
* unfamiliar, but.
      * as noted by a current Python 2 dev.
      * e.g. type hints/annotations.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>In summary...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="next"> <b>Making contributions to unfamiliar projects</b>...
        <ul>
          <li class="next"> is not just an October pursuit
          <li class="next"> is a great way to enhance & test Python skills
          <li class="next"> ...<i>but</i> initial investment needed to set-up &
                            gain familiarity with each project (& see &#10020;).
        </ul>

      <li class="next"><b>My key Hacktober '18 Python takeaways</b>:
        <ul>
          <li class="next"> <b>#1</b>: leverage that Python is versatile
          <li class="next"> <b>#4</b>: be mindful of the diverse community
          <li class="next"> <b>#3</b>: a project is more than its
                                       functional code
          <li class="next"> <b>#4</b> &#10020;: set-up can be tricky
          <li class="next"> <b>#5</b>: Python 3 seems cool!
        </ul>
