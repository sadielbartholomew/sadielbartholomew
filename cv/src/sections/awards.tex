	{Fellowship, 2022 cohort | Software Sustainability Institute {\normalfont ~[\href{https://www.software.ac.uk/news/announcing-2022-software-sustainability-institute-fellows}{\small{\websiteSymbol}}]}}{Jan. 2022 - Present}

	    \textit{(Continuing) Fellow}
	}
	{
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Awarded a \href{https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme}{funded fellowship} from the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), an organisation dedicated to improving software in research. This recognised me as an emergent ambassador of good computational practice in the earth science domain, with a focus on high-performance computing (HPC) and green software.
     \item Duration for funding, totalling Â£3,000, was 15 months (from Jan. 2022, though extended due to knock-on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic) but the programme encourages continued engagement (``Once a Fellow, always a Fellow") and provides opportunity to apply for further funding. Effort and funding went, and continue, primarily towards:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item purchase of components for a computer cluster built around 8 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B computers to be used in particular for HPC training and outreach/educational events as well as towards CATS version 2 testing;
     \item attendance at annual SSI Collaborations Workshops aiming to form new collaborations (successful outcomes include joining a community dedicated to green computing and the CATS team, see above).
     \end{itemize}
