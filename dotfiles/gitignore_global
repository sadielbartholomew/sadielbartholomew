# Note: choose not to globally 'git ignore' commonly-ignored files & dirs e.g:
#   *.py[cdo]
#   **/__pycache__/
#   *.o
#   *.so
# in order to (essentially) fully monitor the git ignore properties on
# individual repositories, on a per-repository basis, since it is best that
# they have their own appropriate .gitignore files that may need creating or
# updating. Instead only globally ignore my own dedicated directories and files
# desgined e.g. to hold notes and stdout or stderr for debugging or dev plans:

*.sadie
**/sadie.d/
