### Abstract:

*Cylc is a workflow engine, allowing anyone to run a custom schedule of
inter-dependent tasks. Its general-purpose open-source nature has led to a
technically diverse user base, from scientists & other RSEs to HPC analysts
and operational forecasting staff, distributed across research centres
worldwide. Development has been driven by the requirements of users; it has
been a ongoing challenge to cater for the unique automation needs emerging
from such varied contexts, for example building a system that scales both
down, to transcend mere cron jobs, and up, to complex workflows of thousands
of tasks. Hosting Cylc publicly on GitHub has been vital, enabling input,
including code contributions, from all factions, and centralising
communication between our international team working under inverse time zones.
We invest much of our time providing training and support in the effective
use of Cylc and notably at the Met Office our users have spun-up their own
community group for effective and maintainable Cylc workflow design, adding
the balancing act of directing, but not dictating, best practice. Hear us
share our wisdom from the pursuit of reproducible workflows for all.*


## Notes on my contribution

Towards this talk I did the following:

* wrote the submission for the sucessful application to give a talk, including
  the above abstract;
* agreed on a choice of presentation technology (``impress.js``) & a plan for
  content & preparation with my co-speaker;
* set-up the basic ``impress.js`` slides framework;
* created the slides for the second half of the talk (``usage-and-community``
  to ``how-to-install`` tagged slides) plus jointly developed opening & closing
  slides.
* provided feedback on my co-presenter's slides & spoken content;
* presented the second half of talk & jointly answered questions at the end.
